<h1 style="color:red;"> Why I Chose JesterSeals</h1>
<h2 style="color:green;">I chose JesterSeals because it's based off a game called SOCOM U.S NAVY SEALS for the PS2 and there was someone in the team in the missions called Jester and I liked that name
so i put JesterSeals because his name is Jester and he is in the seals (duh) but it's just a nickname and it's not my real name though (also duh) but i always wanted to use the name because my old nickname
was kind of used for uhh bullshit so i changed my name to JesterSeals i was thinking about putting Z at the end but i liked the way it sounded with a normal s so i sticked with s and it become something to me
so thus i use it but i sometimes just look back at the name and kind of smile because SOCOM U.S NAVY SEALS was like the first game i have ever played on the PS2 and it kinda is what made me become the person
i am to this day. </h2>
